"Rule 1: The Doctor lies."
"I am and always will be the optimist. The hoper of far-flung hopes and the dreamer of improbable dreams."
"The way I see it, every life is a pile of good things and bad things. The good things don't always soften the bad things, but vice versa, the bad things don't always spoil the good things and make them unimportant."
"Everybody knows that everybody dies. But not every day. Not today. Some days are special. Some days are so, so blessed. Some days, nobody dies at all. Now and then, every once in a very long while, every day in a million days, when the wind stands fair, and the Doctor comes to call, everybody lives."
"You don't just give up. You don't just let things happen. You make a stand! You say no! You have the guts to do what's right, even when everyone else just runs away."
"Some people live more in 20 years than others do in 80. It's not the time that matters, it's the person."
"You know, the very powerful and the very stupid have one thing in common: they don't alter their views to fit the facts; they alter the facts to fit their views."
"Never cruel or cowardly. Never give up, never give in."
"Rest is for the weary, sleep is for the dead."
"Hermits United. We meet up every 10 years, swap stories about caves. It's good fun… for a hermit."
"There's a lot of things you need to get across this universe. Warp drive… wormhole refractors… You know the thing you need most of all? You need a hand to hold."
"People assume that time is a strict progression of cause to effect, but actually from a non-linear, non-subjective viewpoint — it's more like a big ball of wibbly wobbly… time-y wimey… stuff."
"Amy Pond, there's something you'd better understand about me ‘cause it's important, and one day your life may depend on it: I am definitely a madman with a box!"
"Don't blink. Don't even blink. Blink and you're dead. Don't turn your back. Don't look away. And don't blink."
"I'll be a story in your head. That's OK. We're all stories in the end. Just make it a good one, eh? ‘Cause it was, you know. It was the best. The daft old man who stole a magic box and ran away. Did I ever tell you that I stole it? Well, I borrowed it. I was always going to take it back."
"One may tolerate a world of demons for the sake of an angel."
"Rose, before I go, I just want to tell you: you were fantastic. Absolutely fantastic. And you know what? So was I."
"Good men don't need rules."
"Never run when you're scared."
"If we're going to die, let's die looking like a Peruvian folk band."
"He's like fire and ice. He's like the night and the storm in the heart of the sun. He's ancient and forever. He burns at the center of time and he can see the turn of the universe. And… he's wonderful."
"What's the point in two hearts if you can't be a bit forgiving now and then?"
"There's no point in being grown-up if you can't be childish sometimes."
"When you're a kid, they tell you it's all: grow up, get a job, get married, get a house, have a kid, and that's it. But the truth is, the world is so much stranger than that. It's so much darker. And so much madder. And so much better."
"You want weapons? We're in a library! Books! The best weapons in the world!"
"Letting it get to you. You know what that's called? Being alive. Best thing there is. Being alive right now is all that counts."
"Superior intelligence and senseless cruelty just do not go together."
"A straight line may be the shortest distance between two points, but it is by no means the most interesting."
"Come on, Rory! It isn't rocket science, it's just quantum physics!"
"If you step on a butterfly, you change the future of the human race."
"The way I see it, every life is a pile of good things and… bad things. The good things don't always soften the bad things, but vice versa, the bad things don't necessarily spoil the good things or make them unimportant."
"The universe has to move forward. Pain and loss, they define us as much as happiness or love. Whether it's a world, or a relationship… Everything has its time. And everything ends."
"Big flashy things have my name written all over them. Well… not yet. Give me time and a crayon."
"Never ignore coincidence. Unless, of course, you're busy. In which case, always ignore coincidence."
"In 900 years of time and space, I've never met anyone who wasn't important."
"We had chips. So anyway, planet gone. All rocks and dust, but the human race lives on, spread out across the stars. Soon as the Earth burns up, ooh, they get all nostalgic, big revival movement. They find this place. Same size as the Earth. Same air, same orbit. Lovely. The call goes out, the humans move in."
"But here she is, Rose Tyler! Hm, she's not the best I've ever had. Bit too blonde. Not too steady on her pins. A lot of that (makes a movement with his hand to indicate she talks too much). And just last week she stared into the heart of the time vortex and aged 57 years. But she'll do."
"Biting's excellent. It's like kissing — only there is a winner."

"Never be certain of anything. It's a sign of weakness."
"Courage isn't just a matter of not being frightened, you know. It's being afraid and doing what you have to do, anyway."
"The universe is big. It's vast and complicated and ridiculous. And sometimes, very rarely, impossible things just happen and we call them miracles."
"Do what I do. Hold tight and pretend it's a plan!"
"Nine hundred years of time and space, and I've never been slapped by someone's mother."
"Letting it get to you. You know what that's called? Being alive. Best thing there is. Being alive right now is all that counts."
"This is one corner of one country, in one continent, on one planet that's a corner of a galaxy that's a corner of a universe that is forever growing and shrinking and creating and destroying and never remaining the same for a single millisecond. And there is so much, so much to see."
"There's something that doesn't make sense. Let's go and poke it with a stick."
"Bow ties are cool."
"You know when sometimes you meet someone so beautiful, and then you actually talk to them, and five minutes later they're dull as a brick. But then there's other people, and you meet them and you think ‘not bad, they're OK', and then you get to know them, and their face sort of becomes them, like their personality's written all over it, and they just they turn into something so beautiful…"
"I don't know. I can't tell the future I just work there."
"You know when grown-ups tell you everything's going to be fine, but you really think they're lying to make you feel better? Everything's going to be fine."

"You should always waste time when you don't have any. Time is not the boss of you. Rule 408."
"Didn't anyone ever tell you? There's one thing you never put in a trap if you're smart. If you value your continued existence, if you have any plans about seeing tomorrow, there's one thing you never, ever put in a trap. Me."
"Go to your room! Go to your room! I mean it. I'm very, very angry with you. I'm very, very cross! GO! TO! YOUR! ROOM! (The children lurch away and obey him) I'm really glad that worked. Those would have been terrible last words."
"You don't want to take over the universe. You wouldn't know what to do with it beyond shout at it."
"Never knowingly be serious. Rule 27."
"You think you know your own name? How stupid are you?"
"So is this how it works, Doctor? You never interfere with the affairs of other peoples or planets, unless there are children crying?"
"I traveled across the world. From the ruins of New York to the fusion mills of China, right across the radiation pits of Europe. And everywhere I went I saw people just like you, living as slaves! But if Martha Jones became a legend, then that's wrong, because my name isn't important. There's someone else. The man who sent me out there, the man who told me to walk the Earth. And his name is The Doctor. He has saved your lives so many times and you never even knew he was there. He never stops. He never stays. He never asks to be thanked. But I've seen him, I know him… I love him… and I know what he can do."
"Though the man above might say hello, expect no love from the beast below."
"When I was your age — about, ooh, a thousand years ago — I loved a good bedtime story. The Three Little Sontarans. The Emperor Dalek's New Clothes. Snow White and the Seven Keys to Doomsday, eh? All the classics."
"I saw the Fall of Troy! World War Five! I was pushing boxes at the Boston Tea Party! Now I'm gonna die in a dungeon…. (disgustedly) in Cardiff!"

"I'd forgotten not all victories are about saving the universe."
"Don't play games with me! You just killed someone I like, that is not a safe place to stand! I'm the Doctor, and you're in the biggest library in the Universe. Look me up."
"I have lived a long life, and I have seen a few things. I walked away from the Last Great Time War. I marked the passing of the Time Lords. I saw the birth of the universe and I watched as time ran out, moment by moment, until nothing remained; no time, no space. Just me. I walked in universes where the laws of physics were devised by the mind of a madman. I watched universes freeze and creations burn. I have seen things you wouldn't believe, I have lost things you will never understand. And I know things, secrets that must never be told, knowledge that must never be spoken. Knowledge that will make parasite gods blaze! So come on then! Take it! Take it all, baby! Have it! You have it all!"

"Think you've seen it all? Think again. Outside those doors, we might see anything. We could find new worlds, terrifying monsters, impossible things. And if you come with me… nothing will ever be the same again!"
"The Fourth Great and Bountiful Human Empire. And there it is: planet Earth at its height. Covered with megacities, five moons, population 96 billion. The hub of a galactic domain, stretching across a million planets, a million species. With mankind right in the middle."
"Oh, the pointing again. They're screwdrivers! What are you going to do? Assemble a cabinet at them?"
"Rose wasn't ‘ordinary'. What was I supposed to do? Wrap her in cotton wool? Tell her, ‘Here, I could give you the universe, but I'm not going to in case you get hurt? There's all this stuff out there, all these planets, all these wonders, but I want you to stay at home and work in a shop?'"
"I've remembered that my name is Smith. Almost definitely. Good old English name. Hopefully means ‘noble valiant warrior' and not ‘he who hits kittens with a hammer.' You'd be surprised the derivations of common surnames in the English countryside…"
"I'm about to do something very clever and a tiny bit against the rules of the universe. It's important that I'm properly dressed."
"The secret is not just to be stunning, which I find comes rather easily, to be honest. The tricky thing is getting exactly the right level of stun for the occasion."
"We're dealing with a psycho-temporal entity manifesting through a critical mass of its sentient shell… um. Magic sounds more fun."

"I'm going to tell you a story about a man who travels, and everywhere he goes, he makes everyone's lives better. I'm not that man. That man doesn't exist. I wish he did. I'd believe in him."
"Don't worry, I'm shielding you. When we crashed here and it first attacked me, I was caught with my mental trousers down. Not anymore. Psychic force field's intact. Belts and braces. Braces, by the way, are very cool."
"I'm not running away from things, I am running to them. Before they flare and fade forever."
"It is difficult to know what will be a waste of time until after the time has been wasted, by which time it is too late. So predicting what will be a waste of time is something of a waste of time. Unless it gives you pleasure, of course when it probably doesn't count as a waste of time."
"Something pretty bad's happening nearby in the space-time continuum. The TARDIS is a terrible rubbernecker, like a little old lady, she can't resist slowing down for a gawp at a car crash in the next lane. Bless."
"I do think there's always a way to put things right. If I didn't believe that I wouldn't get out of bed in the morning, I wouldn't eat breakfast; I wouldn't leave the TARDIS ever. I would never have left home. There is always something we can do."
"Which brings me to you, Prince Boris. And I'm sorry, but here's the thing… I think you're one of the nicest Russian aristocrats I've ever met and not been forced into an arranged marriage with."
"How come "burbled" gets to be in the Oxford English Dictionary but "tulgy" doesn't? Hm?"
"We might as well get started. Help to pass the timey-wimey. Do you have to talk like children? What is it that makes you so ashamed of being a grown-up? Oh. The way you both look at me. I'm trying to think of a better word than ‘dread'?"
"From the day they arrive on the planet, and blinking step into the sun, there's more to see than can ever be seen, more to- wait that's The Lion King."
