   Content: People are telling you it's skipable, but I really don't think it is!

Death in Heaven ends with the Doctor and Clara going their separate ways, they both agree to stop traveling with each other. The Doctor believes Clara found Danny, and Clara believes the Doctor found Gallifrey.

Last Christmas resolves those issues. 

If you skip straight to series 9, you're going to miss how all of that gets addressed/resolved.

   Content: Yes, it's somewhat skippable, although it does have some character beats.

If it's a rewatch then "Husbands of River Song" and "The Return of Doctor Mysterio" are also both skippable.

   Content: Just to clarify: this was filmed outside of the Doctor Who Exhibition in Cardiff, and the sign visible belongs to that.

   Content: I feel like whoever plays the doctor needs to at least feel a bit older. Like they have experienced a lot of stuff. I know Matt Smith was only 26 when cast but he always seemed significantly older than Gillan and Darvill at least to me. Both Alexander and Lydia west (who’s also been linked with the role having worked with RTD) seem far too young to me

   Content: I kind of agree. I think RTD will likely be scoring for either someone that fits the conceit if a Doctor he wants to run with or he’ll already have a few names in mind and is seeing who’s interested/he likes best for the role.
